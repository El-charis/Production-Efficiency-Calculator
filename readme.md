# Production Efficiency Calculator

This is a web application that calculates production efficiency metrics such as Asset Intensity and Speed Loss based on user inputs of good production quantity, nominal speed, and occupied time.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the required values:
   - Good Production (Quantity in Cases): Quantity of product complying with quality specifications.
   - Nominal Speed (Cases per hour): The expected speed of production in terms of quantity per hour.
   - Occupied Time (hours): The total time the production line is occupied.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to see the results.
4. The calculated Asset Intensity and Speed Loss will be displayed.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure and content of the web application.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the web application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for calculating production efficiency metrics.

## How It Works

The web application uses JavaScript to perform calculations based on the input values provided by the user. These calculations are then displayed on the web page.
